Playing Around with 3D Shapes
The next addition to your broadcast design will be to add some 3D rectangular shapes that
will fly by the camera. Adding design elements can contribute a sense of movement to a
composition as well as kinetic visual interest. You will start with only one shape and then
use the Duplicate node to place multiple offset, cloned shapes in your scene. Like the text,
you’ll first create these elements independent of the main composition and then merge
them in later.
1 Click in an empty area of the Node Editor to the right of the Text node.
We’ll use the Select tool dialog to add a Shape 3D node. By clicking in an empty area
of the Node Editor, you are identifying where the node will be located when you add it.
2 Press Shift-Spacebar to bring up the Select Tool dialog, and type in shape.
3 From the list of tools, select the Shape 3D tool, and click Add to add the tool to the
Node Editor.
